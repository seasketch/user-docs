## Navigating Discussion Forums

To access a project's discussion forums, click 'Discussion Forums' or the comment symbol  in the main menu. The Discussion Forum layout is shown below.

## Viewing Discussions and Plans

You can click on a forum and then a thread, or jump right into a thread on the 'Latest Discussions' feed. Once in a thread you'll likely see comments and plans from other project participants. A checkbox appears next plans — click the checkbox to add that plan to the map viewer.

### Generating reports on plans

You can view reports on plans same as in the Overlay Layers interface — simply right click on the plan and select 'View Reports'.

## Contributing to Discussions

To contribute, scroll to the bottom of a thread — there you can type a reply and share plans.
