<summary>How can I download a plan (vector file) from a forum?</summary>

Plans that have been shared to a forum topic may be downloaded as GeoJSON files. Any user with access to the forum may do so. Simply navigate to the post containing the plan, right click on the plan name, and select <img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png" alt="" data-size="line">.
