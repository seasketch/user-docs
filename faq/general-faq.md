# General FAQ

<details>

<summary>Is SeaSketch free?</summary>

Yes, SeaSketch is free to use under the open source BSD license provided by the University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB). The McClintock Lab at UCSB's National Center for Ecological Analysis may also be contracted to help configure and implement SeaSketch. Contracts may be particularly helpful if you intend to use SeaSketch's analytical tools which require expertise in Javascript to develop.&#x20;

<summary><strong>Can I pull the map services in SeaSketch into ArcGIS Desktop?</strong> </summary>

Yes and no. Many of the map services that are displayed in SeaSketch are coming from ArcGIS Server. If you have direct access to that server, and if you have the right credentials, you can create a connection in ArcCatalog which then allows you to bring those services into ArcGIS Desktop. For many SeaSketch projects, administrators have added map services that are not password-protected and, therefore, it's easy to create a connection to the server where the services originate.

<summary>How can I download a plan (shapefile) from a forum?</summary>

Plans that have been shared to a forum topic may be downloaded as shapefiles. Any user with access to the forum may do so. Simply enter the forum topic, click on the gear icon in the upper right corner of the forum, and choose "download shapefile of plans." If multiple sketch classes are present, a separate shapefile will be generated for each sketch class. Multiple sketches of the same sketch class will be saved to a single shapefile with multiple features (one for each sketch).&#x20;

<summary>How can I search for map layers?</summary>

Using the search box at the top of the [Data Layers](../guides/data-layers.md) tab, you may search for map layers within your project. Layers will be searched based on the layer name and any metadata and keywords that have been added by the administrator of the project.
