# Sketching Tools

## Navigate to Sketching Tools

To get started sketching, click 'Sketching Tools' or the polygon symbol <img src=".gitbook/assets/image (11).png" alt="" data-size="line"> in the main menu. If you haven't made any sketches yet, the panel that appears will be blank as shown below.

## Create a New Sketch

To create a sketch, click 'Create' at the top of the panel. A dropdown menu will appear containing the various "sketch classes" that pertain to your project. The exact list of classes and parameters associated with each class tend to be unique to each project. If you're not sure which sketch class to use, talk to a project administrator.

## Sketching

Once you've selected the type of sketch you want to create, you'll enter the sketching interface in which you can draw your desired area on the map and give it a name and description.&#x20;

### Sketching a shape

To start sketching, move your cursor onto the map viewer and click to create the first vertex of your polygon. From here, continue clicking to create additional vertices along the perimeter of your envisioned shape. When your shape is complete you can either double-click the end point or click your starting point to finish editing.&#x20;

### Automatic Clipping

When you finish editing a shape, you'll see its boundary briefly light up and become animated. Once this is complete, some parts of your shape might be cropped or clipped out. Most sketch classes will automatically remove certain areas whether they be land, areas extending beyond EEZ boundaries, or other areas specific to the project.&#x20;

### Editing and deleting shapes

Once your shape has finished clipping and appears green and static, you can delete or edit it by clicking on it.

To delete your shape and start over, simply click the trashcan symbol <img src=".gitbook/assets/image (10).png" alt="" data-size="line"> in the menu near the bottom of the screen.

To edit your shape, you can drag existing vertices to new locations, or click and drag the smaller orange points between vertices to create new ones.

Click <img src=".gitbook/assets/image.png" alt="" data-size="line"> at the bottom when finished.

### Add name and description

Adding a distinctive name and informative description is crucial for collaborative design efforts.
