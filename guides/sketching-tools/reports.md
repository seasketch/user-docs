### Navigating reports

Reports contain at least two sections which you can navigate between using the tabs at the top of the report window. Two common sections are 'Viability' and 'Representation', as shown below. Scrolling down, you can view the various components of the current section.

### Viewing report layers

Each report metric is calculated using a specific data layer. You can view the associated layer in the map viewer with the 'Map' toggle <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/map-toggle.png" alt="" data-size="line"> located to the right of the report item.
