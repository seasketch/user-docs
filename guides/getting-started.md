## Basic Page Layout

When you have made it to your project homepage, read the About This Project window thoroughly.  Then, “x” out in the top right corner to begin using SeaSketch.

SeaSketch can be divided into a _**Map Viewer**_ on the left, with three main tabs on the right.  These three tabs contain the three main functions of the tool: _**Data Layers**_, _**My Plans**_ (for sketching, editing, and analyzing), and _**Participate**_ (with forums and surveys).

Not all users will have access to all three tabs.  Project administrators may also set restrictions on what data you have access to, what forums and surveys are visible to you, which forums to which you can respond, and what types of sketches you can create.

_**To learn more about what you can do in the map viewer and the three tabs, read the introductory articles for each one, next up in this intro series!**_
