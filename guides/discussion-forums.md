## Navigating Discussion Forums

## Viewing Discussions and Plans

You can click on a forum and then a thread, or jump right into a thread on the 'Latest Discussions' feed. Once in a thread you'll likely see comments and plans from other project participants. A checkbox appears next plans — click the checkbox to add that plan to the map viewer.
