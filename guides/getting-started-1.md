## Basic Page Layout

On any SeaSketch project page you'll see a page layout like the one below.

The project landing page is composed of the main menu on the left and the map viewer on the right. These elements are described in detail in the following sections.&#x20;

## Signing In

To sign in, click 'Sign In' on the main menu.  Here, you may enter your login credentials, sign in using Google, or create an account. (see below for details).

## Creating Your Profile and Joining a Project

Once you've logged into your account, you can create a profile and join the project you're interested in. Joining a project is necessary to participate in discussion forums and allows administrators to grant you access to protected data layers.

To create your profile start by clicking 'My Profile' on the main menu — this should appear as an option if you have successfully signed in to your account. That link will take you here:

From this page you can edit your profile. The only field required to join the project is your full name, but you can add a profile picture, nickname (username), email, and affiliations to better identify yourself in discussion forums.\
\
Simply fill in your name, add any optional information, and click 'Join Project'. Once you've joined, you should be returned to the project homepage. You can edit your profile at any time by clicking the same 'My Profile' link. \
\
Once you've joined the project, you can start exploring and contributing! The full suite of SeaSketch tools you can use to do so are outlined in the following sections.
