## Viewing Data Layers in the Map Viewer

To view the list of data layers contained in the project click 'Overlay Layers' or the layer stack<img src="../.gitbook/assets/image.png" alt="" data-size="line"> icon.\
\
In most projects, layers will be organized into folders. Click the arrow <img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (8).png" alt="" data-size="line"> next to a folder to expand the contents. Click a layer to add it to the map. You can add multiple layers.

## Layer Values

Some layers will display their attributes when you hover your cursor over them. This may be a feature classification (like the example below), or a pixel value

## Viewing Metadata

To view a data layer's metadata (information about the layer), right click and select 'Metadata' from the drop down menu.



View symbology of the data layers displayed.  Notice there are three layers displayed on the map.  All three have a light box that decodes what the map symbols represent.

\-**Change the order** of how data is displayed by clicking on the arrows at the far right of each data layer name.  This can be helpful when viewing many data layers simultaneously.

\-**Adjust transparency** by clicking on the shaded circle at the far right of the data layer name.  A slider bar will appear, and you may slide from opaque down through levels of transparency.  This can be helpful when viewing many data layers simultaneously.

\-**Restore default order and transparency** by clicking the link at the bottom right of the legend.
