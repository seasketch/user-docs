## Viewing the Legend

View symbology of the data layers displayed.  Notice there are three layers displayed on the map.  All three have a light box that decodes what the map symbols represent.

\-**Change the order** of how data is displayed by clicking on the arrows at the far right of each data layer name.  This can be helpful when viewing many data layers simultaneously.

\-**Adjust transparency** by clicking on the shaded circle at the far right of the data layer name.  A slider bar will appear, and you may slide from opaque down through levels of transparency.  This can be helpful when viewing many data layers simultaneously.

\-**Restore default order and transparency** by clicking the link at the bottom right of the legend.
